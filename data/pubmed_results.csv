41131427,Systemic Metabolic Alterations After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Plasma Metabolomics Approach.,Yang Bosco Seong Kyu; Savarraj Jude P J; Chen Hua; Hinds Sarah N; Torres Glenda L; Ryan Alice S; Atem Folefac D; Lorenzi Philip L; Ren Xuefang S; McCullough Louise D; Badjatia Neeraj; Choi Huimahn A; Gusdon Aaron M,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) causes systemic changes that contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Systemic metabolomic profiles following aSAH were characterized and examined for their ability to predict outcomes. Blood samples prospectively collected within 24 h (T1) of admission and 7 days (T2) post ictus from patients with aSAH at two tertiary care centers were retrospectively analyzed. Samples from healthy individuals and patients with nonneurologic critical illness served as controls. A validated external analysis platform was used to perform untargeted metabolomics. Clinical data were prospectively collected and adjudicated. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify metabolomic profiles defining each group and delineating relevant metabolic pathways. Machine learning (ML) models for outcome prediction were developed, incorporating key metabolites. A total of 70 subjects with aSAH, 30 healthy controls, and 17 sick controls were included. Groups were matched among key clinical variables. DCI occurred in 36% of subjects with aSAH, and poor functional outcome occurred in 70% at discharge. Metabolomic profiles readily discriminated the groups. aSAH subjects demonstrated mobilization of lipid metabolites, with increased levels of free fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, and diacylglycerols compared with control groups (average 1.8-fold increase; q < 0.05). Circulating amino acid-derived metabolites were significantly decreased, showing an average 30% reduction (q < 0.05), consistent with increased catabolism. DCI was associated with increased sphingolipids (2.1-fold) and decreased acylcarnitines (1.9-fold) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (1.2-fold) at T1 (p < 0.05). Decreased lysophospholipids (1.4-fold) and acylcarnitines (1.5-fold) were associated with poor outcomes (p < 0.05). Incorporating metabolites into ML models improved prediction of DCI compared with clinical variables alone (elastic net linear regression p < 0.01, extreme gradient boosting p = 0.016). Profound metabolic shifts occur after aSAH, with characteristic increases in lipid and decreases in amino acid metabolite levels. This sentence should read: 'Key lipid metabolites (sphingolipids, lysophospholipids, and acylcarnitines) associated with outcomes provide insight into the pathophysiological changes driving secondary complications after aSAH. These metabolites may be useful biomarkers to improve prognostication and personalize aSAH care."
41131122,Optimizing YOLOv11 for automated classification of breast cancer in medical images.,Abd El-Hafeez Tarek; Tarek Mohamed; Sayed Awny,"Breast cancer diagnosis via histopathology image analysis is a complex and subjective process. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for automation, achieving high accuracy across diverse cancer subtypes and magnification levels remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Novel-MultiScaleAttention model, an advanced architecture designed to capture discriminative features across multiple morphological scales in histopathology images. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two publicly available benchmark datasets: a large binary classification dataset (Breast Cancer - v1, N = 16,652 images, M_100X vs. B_100X) and the more complex 8-class subset of the BreakHis dataset (N = 4,914 images). Our proposed model is rigorously compared against state-of-the-art baselines, including YOLO11base, ResNet18, EfficientNet, and MobileNet. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance, attaining a top accuracy of 0.9808 and a macro AUC of 0.9978 on the binary dataset. On the challenging 8-class dataset, it achieves a leading accuracy of 0.9363 and a macro AUC of 0.9956, outperforming other models in overall discriminative ability. Furthermore, a detailed computational analysis reveals a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. An in-depth error analysis identifies specific misclassification patterns, aligning with known diagnostic challenges in pathology. The findings confirm that the Novel-MultiScaleAttention model provides an accurate framework for breast cancer histopathology image classification, demonstrating strong generalization capability across two distinct datasets and showing potential to serve as a valuable decision-support tool in clinical settings."
41130534,Aging as an active player in Alzheimer's Disease Classification: Insights from feature selection in BrainAge Models.,Condado Jorge Garcia; Recuero Ines Verdugo; Elorriaga Iñigo Tellaetxe; Birkhenbil Colin; Carrigan Maria; Diez Ibai; Buckley Rachel F; Erramuzpe Asier; Cortes Jesus M,"BrainAge models estimate the biological age of the brain using neuroimaging or clinical features, making them promising tools for studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. However, the reliance of BrainAge models on neuroimaging features such as grey matter volume and hippocampal atrophy, can introduce biases linked to individuals' ages as these features are influenced both by normal aging and Alzheimer's disease progression. The potential presence of such age-biases raises a critical question: can BrainAge models trained to estimate biological brain aging make meaningful contributions to Alzheimer's diagnosis, or does any introduced age-bias conflate aging effects with disease pathology? Understanding how deliberate feature selection impacts this confounding effect is essential for developing reliable age-related biomarkers. We ranked neuroimaging and neuropsychological features based on their mutual information with age and their discriminative power across four clinical groups: cognitively normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, stable Mild Cognitive Impairment and progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment. Iteratively, we trained BrainAge models using different subsets of these features, some optimized for predicting aging and others for discrimination of clinical Alzheimer's disease stages. We assess the error in BrainAge delta, the difference between predicted biological age and chronological age, and evaluate its classification performance across clinical groups. Finally, we compare using deltas for classification with a logistic regression model directly trained on the neuroimaging features used in the BrainAge models. Neuroimaging features are more strongly correlated with aging, while neuropsychological features exhibit greater discriminative power for Alzheimer's disease classification. BrainAge models optimized for age prediction yield deltas that are suboptimal when used for classifying Alzheimer´s disease, whereas models trained to generate deltas optimized to be used for classifying Alzheimer's disease have reduced age prediction accuracy. This trade-off suggests that BrainAge models may not optimally separate aging-related changes from disease-specific alterations. BrainAge models have varying classification accuracy as compared to direct utilization of features in logistic regression. However, BrainAge provides a continuous measure, offering a single output that can be used across clinical stages, in contrast to classification approaches that require explicit labels for each disease stage. Aging significantly affects BrainAge-based classification of Alzheimer's disease. Feature selection plays a critical role in mitigating this effect, as the outputs of models trained to predict age, the deltas, may fail in Alzheimer´s disease classification. These findings underscore the need for task-specific feature selection and model design to ensure that BrainAge models are appropriately applied in neurodegenerative disease research."

41130324,Comparing Human Annotation and Machine Learning Models for Optimizing Zebrafish Behavioral Classification in Seizure Analysis.,Fontana Barbara D; Pretzel Camilla W; Müller Mariana L; Fontoura Kimberly; Mohammed Khadija A; Saccol Eduarda T; Gonçalves Falco L; Uchoa Angela E; Jardim Carolina C; Silva Isabella P; Silva Rossano M; Moraes Hevelyn S; Resmim Cássio M; Canzian Julia; Rosemberg Denis B,"Accurate and scalable behavioral annotation remains a challenge in behavioral neuroscience. Manual scoring is time-consuming, variable across annotators, and may overlook transient behaviors critical for phenotyping. By learning from annotated datasets, supervised machine learning (ML) enables automated classification of behavior with high consistency and reduced bias. We benchmarked five supervised ML algorithms, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and compared data against expert human annotations of seizure-like behaviors in adult zebrafish. Twelve trained raters annotated over 43,000 video frames, enabling direct comparison of model performance with human annotation. After frame-level analysis, we also applied behavior-informed filters and then evaluated block-level temporal aggregation. Annotation variability was driven by behavioral complexity, with ambiguous behaviors showing the lowest agreement. Random Forest, XGBoost, and MLP achieved the highest accuracy and post-processing based on posture and velocity improved classification by filtering false positives. Block-level aggregation enhanced accuracy through temporal smoothing but masked short-lived behaviors critical for detecting subtle phenotypes. Most zebrafish seizure studies rely on manual scoring or single-model ML applications. Direct comparisons between multiple ML algorithms and human annotations are rare. Our study uniquely integrates large-scale manual scoring with model benchmarking and temporal resolution strategies, offering insight into reproducibility and scalability in behavioral phenotyping. This study advances automated behavioral analysis in zebrafish by demonstrating the strengths and limitations of machine learning compared to human annotation, and emphasizes how choices in temporal resolution and behavioral classification influence reproducibility and interpretability."
41130192,Advancing DNA and RNA Modification Detection via Nanopore Sequencing.,He Bo; Fan Yu; Liu Jizhou; Chen Yuting; Yang Jinmin; Xiang Huifen; Peng Jinying; Yi Chengqi,"DNA/RNA modifications are crucial for biological processes. To understand their regulatory mechanisms, precise mapping and quantification of these modifications are essential. Although next-generation sequencing can detect the location and stoichiometry of modifications, complex treatments are required, hindering efficiency and long-range analysis. In contrast, nanopore sequencing eliminates the need for additional treatment and PCR amplification, thus preserving DNA/RNA modification information. It enables modifications to be identified and quantified directly at the single-molecule level. Therefore, nanopore sequencing facilitates long-read, real-time modification detection, and has gained widespread applications. This perspective introduces the principles of nanopore sequencing, evaluates its strengths/weaknesses, and critically examines its broader real-world applications. To expand the utility of nanopore sequencing further, we discuss the current challenges and suggest future directions."
41130109,"Effects of imidazole and triazole on burr medic and oilseed rape seedlings: Phytotoxicity, transformation, and bioaccumulation.",Karnaeva Anastasia E; Milyushkin Aleksey L; Khazanova Kseniya P; Rostanets Dmitry V,"Pesticides are chemical substances of natural or synthetic origin used to control pests and insects. Environmental pollution occurs when pesticide contamination spreads away from the target plants. Pesticides and their transformation products can have adverse effects on both target and non-target plants and organisms. Azole antifungals, which are imidazole and 1H-1,2,4-triazole derivatives, are the most commonly used agents for treating invasive fungal infections. Imidazole and 1H-1,2,4-triazole are important degradation products of these substances. In this study, Brassica napus (oilseed rape) and Medicago polymorpha (burr medic) were used as test plants for imidazole and 1H-1,2,4-triazole accumulation and leaching experiments, and the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda was used to determine their toxicity. Burr medic was found to absorb more 1H-1,2,4-triazole, whereas oilseed rape absorbed imidazole more rapidly with increasing concentrations. Imidazole leached from both species over time in the absence of an external pollutant source significantly faster than 1H-1,2,4-triazole. The algae experiment showed that 1H-1,2,4-triazole was more toxic than imidazole, and a mixture of imidazole and 1H-1,2,4-triazole at low concentrations was more toxic than the individual substances. Using GC-MS/MS, HPLC-MS/MS and machine learning methods, previously unknown imidazole metabolites in oilseed rape tissues were detected and their structures determined."
41127930,AI-Driven Variant Annotation for Precision Oncology in Breast Cancer.,Shukla Kriti; Wang Yue; Spanheimer Philip M; Brunk Elizabeth,"Interpreting the functional impact of genomic variants remains a major challenge in precision oncology, particularly in breast cancer, where many variants of unknown significance lack clear therapeutic guidance. Current annotation strategies focus on frequent driver mutations, leaving rare or understudied variants unclassified and clinically uninformative. Here, we present an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-driven framework that systematically identifies variants associated with key breast cancer phenotypes, including ESR1 and EZH2 activity, by integrating genomic, transcriptomic, structural, and drug response data. Using CCLE/DepMap and TCGA datasets, we analyzed > 12,000 variants across breast cancer genomes, identifying structurally clustered mutations that share functional consequences with well-characterized oncogenic drivers. This approach reveals that mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, and other genes strongly associate with ESR1 signaling, challenging conventional assumptions about endocrine therapy response. Additionally, EZH2-associated variants emerge in unexpected genomic contexts, suggesting new targets for epigenetic therapies. By shifting from frequency-based to structure-informed classification, we expand the set of potentially actionable mutations, enabling improved patient stratification and drug repurposing strategies. This work provides a scalable, clinically relevant method to accelerate variant annotation, offering new insights into drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms. Future validation efforts will refine these predictions and integrate clinical outcomes to guide personalized treatment strategies. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of AI/ML in redefining cancer variant interpretation, bridging the gap between genomics, functional biology, and precision medicine."

41127826,Identifying the Key Mitochondria-Related Genes in COPD by Integrating Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Analyses.,Qu Jiajia; Zhang Mengyu; Hu Yajie; Yang Guang; Zhang Xiaoning; Zhang Wenqing; Qu Yiqing,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a prevalent chronic respiratory disorder with high morbidity and mortality, is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study is to identify mitochondrial hub genes and evaluate their diagnostic potential in COPD. This study combined bioinformatics and experimental methods to investigate mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (MitoDEGs) in COPD pathogenesis. Two GEO datasets (GSE38974/GSE8545) were analyzed to identify MitoDEGs, which were functionally characterized and refined via machine learning (LASSO/SVM-RFE). Key genes were further validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot in bronchial epithelial cells and COPD mouse model lung tissues. Immune infiltration analysis revealed connections between MitoDEGs and immune dysregulation in COPD that were experimentally confirmed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). Among 28 identified MitoDEGs, five feature genes (<i>BAX</i>, <i>DLST</i>, <i>FKBP10</i>, <i>FUNDC2</i>, and <i>RMDN1</i>) were selected. Subsequent validation through qRT-PCR, Western blot, and ROC curve further confirmed <i>BAX</i> and <i>DLST</i> as core hub genes. Immune profiling revealed significantly increased M0 macrophage infiltration and reduced activated NK cells in COPD. BAX and DLST expression was positively correlated with M0 macrophages but negatively with activated NK cells, a finding corroborated by IHC and IF assays. These findings highlight <i>BAX</i> and <i>DLST</i> as potential mitochondrial dysfunction biomarkers in COPD, linking their roles to immune cell infiltration. This study provides novel insights into cigarette smoke-induced COPD pathogenesis and underscores the diagnostic utility of targeting mitochondrial-immune interactions."
